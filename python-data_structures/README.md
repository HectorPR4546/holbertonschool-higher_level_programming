Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples
Description

This project focuses on the use and manipulation of lists and tuples in Python â€” two essential data structures used to store and access collections of values. Tasks range from basic list indexing and modification to tuple unpacking and handling nested lists (matrices).
Requirements
Python Scripts

    Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs

    All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.8.5

    All Python files must end with a new line

    The first line of all files must be exactly: #!/usr/bin/python3

    A README.md file at the root of the project is mandatory

    Code must follow the pycodestyle (version 2.7.*)

    All Python files must be executable

    File lengths will be tested using wc

Project Structure
File	Description
0-print_list_integer.py	Prints all integers of a list
1-element_at.py	Retrieves an element from a list safely
2-replace_in_list.py	Replaces an element at a specific position
3-print_reversed_list_integer.py	Prints all integers of a list in reverse order
4-new_in_list.py	Replaces an element in a copy of the list
5-no_c.py	Removes all occurrences of 'c' and 'C' from a string
6-print_matrix_integer.py	Prints a matrix of integers (list of lists)
7-add_tuple.py	Adds two tuples element-wise
8-multiple_returns.py	Returns a tuple: (length of string, first character)
9-max_integer.py	Finds the maximum integer in a list
10-divisible_by_2.py	Finds all elements divisible by 2 in a list
11-delete_at.py	Deletes an element at a specific position
12-switch.py	Switches the values of a and b using tuple unpacking
Usage

Run any script individually with Python 3:

$ ./0-print_list_integer.py

    Ensure all files have execution permissions:

$ chmod +x *.py
