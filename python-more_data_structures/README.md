Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary
Description

This project is part of the Holberton School curriculum. It focuses on using advanced Python data structures such as sets and dictionaries, providing a deeper understanding of how to manipulate and operate on these collections efficiently.

You will practice:

    Set operations: union, intersection, difference

    Dictionary operations: creation, update, deletion, traversal

    Using built-in Python functions like map, len, and others with these structures

    Creating utility functions to solve real-world problems using sets and dictionaries

Requirements

    Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs

    Files are interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.8.5

    All files must end with a new line

    The first line of all Python files must be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3

    A README.md file is mandatory

    Code must follow pycodestyle (version 2.7.*)

    All files must be executable

    File lengths are tested using wc
